<h1>Jared Hirsch's digital lilypad</h1>

<p>Hey there ðŸ‘‹ 
  
<p>I am an amateur mathematician and musician, and a professional computer programmer. I'm located just outside of NYC.
  
<p>I work at <a href="//mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>, where I'm on the team that builds the user interface for the open source Firefox web browser.
I'm self-taught, and I work in the open to help provide opportunities for others interested in learning to code; tech is a great career for people with unprofitable creative interests.

<p>I occasionally post photos or general updates at <a rel="me" href="//mastodon.social/@jaredhirsch">mastodon.social</a>, and math-related updates at <a rel="me" href="//mathstodon.xyz/@jaredhirsch">mathstodon.xyz</a>. 

<p>I very rarely write longer technical blog posts at <a href="//6a68.net">6a68.net</a>. Many of my past projects are hosted on <a href="//github.com/jaredhirsch>github</a>.
  
<p>no posts here right now, but I might eventually do more with this site :-)

<p>Update: I have a backup mastodon account at <a rel="me" href="//indieweb.social/@jaredhirsch">indieweb.social</a>, might turn into a more permanent home as the big mastodon.social server hits some growing pains. We'll see.

<p>ðŸš§ site under construction indefinitely ðŸš§
