<p>Hey there. ðŸš§ site under construction indefinitely ðŸš§

<p>no posts here right now, but I do have an <a href="feed.xml">RSS feed</a> for whenever I get something written.

<p>I have a few older posts on <a href="https://6a68.net">6a68.net</a>, and there's a <a href="https://6a68.net/feed.xml">feed</a> for those, too.

I just quit using twitter, and haven't yet decided if I'll really get into mastodon yet,
but I'm <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@jaredhirsch">jaredhirsch@mastodon.social</a> for now.

Update: I'm now also <a rel="me" href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@jaredhirsch">jaredhirsch@mathstodon.xyz</a>, might turn into a more permanent home as the big masto server hits some growing pains.
